## Reddit Client - Capstone Project for CodeCademy Front End Engineer Career Pathway.

Using this app, you can view and search posts on Reddit. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template. I used the undocumented Reddit JSON API by adding .json to the end of any Reddit URL.

**I am in no way affiliated to [Reddit](https://reddit.com). This was created solely for educational purposes.**
